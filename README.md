# Scrollytelling Template

`git clone && npm start` 


The logic in this template depends on the view height of the device. There's no animation, just a minimal change in bg color, so you can add whatever changes you like in each div, or change the number of divs, or remove the change in background color altogether. This is intended as a start for your scrollytelling project, using TS & React.
